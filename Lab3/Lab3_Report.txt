The EmployeeDemo class uses the Employee class to store information about employees.

The Employee and Address class are not completed. We can use the information from the 
EmployeeDemo class to create the Employee and Address classes.

Employee class:
String name and String empId, Address addr, along with get and set methods.

Address class:
String addr1, String addr2, String city, String pin along with get and set methods.

The get and set methods are further used in the employee demo class.

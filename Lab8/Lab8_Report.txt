In DecimalSplitter class isOdd is implemented by checking whether the modulo 2 value of 
the given number is equal to zero. If it is, false is returned, i.e., the number is even
and vice-versa.

To get the whole number only, the double can be type casted to int as int will omit the
fractional part.

To get the fractional part a similar logic can be applied by taking the difference of
original number and the integer (or whole number part of the number).

Code is written in TestMain to convert the command line argument to required double format.

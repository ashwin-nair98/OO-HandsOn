The ResultFinder class has been enhanced with getters and setters for the marks.
The displayMarks and the getResult functions have been defined. As no criteria for 
results were provided, it is assumed that marks >= 35 is pass and if not, failed. The 
count of the passed subjects and failed subjects is returned in getResult method.

Added code in TestMain method to extract marks from command line arguments and storing
within the variables. The set methods from ResultFinder is used to set the marks within the 
object.

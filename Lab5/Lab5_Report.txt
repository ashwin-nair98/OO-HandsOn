To swap two variables through a function, they should be passed by reference.
This is not possible by integers in java.

Thus the scope of the integers is elevated from main method to class so that it can be accessed
by the swap method as well. This removes the need of passing them as arguments from the 
function call. 

It has to be noted that such a method cannot be used for any two int variables, but 
only those stored in class and hard-coded within the swp function.
